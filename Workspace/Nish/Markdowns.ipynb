    "This aim of this project is to build a model that provides top 5 movie recommendations to a user, based on their ratings of other movies fro Hulu. Our audience in this case is the Hulu Technology Team headed by the CTO of Hulu. They are holding a competition to upgrade their current machine learning algorithm that oversees the movie recommendations given to a Hulu user/consumer. "

    "Todays streaming landscape is vast and diverse, with over 1 billion users worldwide and generating over 500 billion dollars in revenue. Hulu currently has 11% market share of the whole industry, trailing behind Netflix(25%), Prime Video(18%), HBO Max(17%) and Disney Plus(14%).It's also important to note that 85% of Hulu users are also subscribed to Netflix.Currently, Hulu uses a item-based collaborative filtering algorithm, this is a successful approach commonly used by many recommender systems, it takes into consideration the ratings given to items by users as the sole source of information for learning to make recommendations. \n",

    "Currently eBooks are outsold by print books at about a 4 to 1 ratio. In 2020 there was 191 million eBooks sold. While Amazon holds over 70% of the market in eBooks via their kindle platform there is a large untapped potential for increasing eBook sales and promoting the use of eReaders compared to print. By utilzing quality recommendation systems Amazon can boost the interest and useablity of eBooks thus improving upon this market. The kindle platform and eBooks in general are incredidly accesibile for anyone with a tablet, smartphone, computer, or eReader. These eBooks can be immediatley purchased from a multitude of platforms and are able to read within minutes of purchase, which is far superior to obtaining a print book. This notion of real time purchase and useablily plays greater into Amazon's one click purchase philsophy.\n",

    "The kindle store is also full of cheap reads, with some eBooks even being free with certain subsripctions like prime and unlimited. A broad span of genres are available ranging from things like self-help books, cookbooks, and photography books to more traditional literature genres like Science Fiction & Fantasy and Romance novels. A final huge plus for the advocacy of eBooks is the ease in which readers can rate and reviews books they have either just read or already read. This can all be done via the same platform used to access and read the eBook (aka kindle). Ultimately this plays into the collection of more review and rating data wich in turn can attribute to better performing recommendations for each indiviudal user. A quality recommendation system can thus create a positive feedback loop that not only enhances itself but promotoes the increase in eBook sales across the board."

    "Surprise was the main library we used to produce our collaborative filtering model.This library has endogenous methods of splitting our data set, cross validating, performing grid searches as well various different algorithms that can be used to build recommendation systems. As you go through this notebook, you will see that we had to use a combination of both surprise and scikit-learn methods to ensure the successful deployment of model. Since the syntax of surprise and sklearn are similar, this made this process much more efficient, it also ensures that the notebook would be readable to anyone with a background in data science. We mainly utilized surprise to transform the data set to a suitable data format that can be used in recommendation systems. We also employed pickling to make loading onto any new computer an easier process. "
