    "Our audience in this case is the Hulu Technology Team headed by the CTO of Hulu. They are holding a competition to upgrade their current machine learning algorithm that oversees the movie recommendations given to a Hulu user/consumer. Our task was to build a model that provides top 5 movie recommendations to a user, based on their ratings of other movies. Currently, Hulu uses a item-based collaborative filtering algorithm, this is a successful approach commonly used by many recommender systems, it takes into consideration the ratings given to items by users as the sole source of information for learning to make recommendation.

    "The main library used to produce a collaborative filtering model was Surprise. Within this package there are methods of cross validating a model, performing grid searchs, and a plethora of algorithms used for recommendation systems. The Surprise syntax is modeled after sklearn and thus should look familar to most Data Scienctist. It utlizes methods such as .fit and .predict. It also contains Dataset readers in order to transform data into the appropriate form for use in recommendation systems. I utlized Pickle to save my final model which can then be loaded into the app.py file for ease of use."
