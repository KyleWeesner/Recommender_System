    "This aim of this project is to build a model that provides top 5 movie recommendations to a user, based on their ratings of other movies fro Hulu. Our audience in this case is the Hulu Technology Team headed by the CTO of Hulu. They are holding a competition to upgrade their current machine learning algorithm that oversees the movie recommendations given to a Hulu user/consumer. "

    "Todays streaming landscape is vast and diverse, with over 1 billion users worldwide and generating over 500 billion dollars in revenue. Hulu currently has 11% market share of the whole industry, trailing behind Netflix(25%), Prime Video(18%), HBO Max(17%) and Disney Plus(14%).It's also important to note that 85% of Hulu users are also subscribed to Netflix.Currently, Hulu uses a item-based collaborative filtering algorithm, this is a successful approach commonly used by many recommender systems, it takes into consideration the ratings given to items by users as the sole source of information for learning to make recommendations.

    "Surprise was the main library we used to produce our collaborative filtering model.This library has endogenous methods of splitting our data set, cross validating, performing grid searches as well various different algorithms that can be used to build recommendation systems. As you go through this notebook, you will see that we had to use a combination of both surprise and scikit-learn methods to ensure the successful deployment of model. Since the syntax of surprise and sklearn are similar, this made this process much more efficient, it also ensures that the notebook would be readable to anyone with a background in data science. We mainly utilized surprise to transform the data set to a suitable data format that can be used in recommendation systems. We also employed pickling to make loading onto any new computer an easier process. "
